# notes - points for a presentation to cover:


What is ChIP-Seq

Technology basics:
Antibodies and immunoprecipitation
How are regulatory sites structured
Library prep steps overview
Analysis steps overview : Sequencing - QC - alignment (bowtie2, options) - Peak calling (macs2) - peak annotation - downstream analysis

Data formats

QC (what is QC information, tools to check and trim data)

Typical ChIP-Seq (peak with mapped reads) and Low-complexity regions

Typical problems (i.e. non-specific binding, overrepresented sequences, data quality, data amount/signal strength)
